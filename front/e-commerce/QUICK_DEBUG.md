# Quick Debugging Steps

## Current Issue
The backend is returning a successful response (200 OK) with tokens, but the frontend is still showing "Login failed!"

## Check These in Browser Console

After clicking Login, expand the console messages and look for:

### 1. Check if response is received
Look for: `✅ Signin SUCCESS - Raw response:`
- If you see this, the backend IS working
- Check what the response object contains

### 2. Check token storage
Look for: `✅ Tokens stored in cookies successfully`
- Then check: `🔍 Verification - Access Token retrieved: YES ✅`
- If it says NO ❌, there's a cookie storage issue

### 3. Check the actual error
Expand the prototype objects in the console to see the actual error message

## Quick Test in Console

After the login attempt, run these commands in browser console:

```javascript
// Check if tokens are in cookies
document.cookie

// Check all cookies
document.cookie.split(';').forEach(c => console.log(c.trim()))

// Try to get tokens manually
const getCookie = (name) => {
  const value = `; ${document.cookie}`;
  const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`);
  if (parts.length === 2) return parts.pop().split(';').shift();
}

console.log('Access Token:', getCookie('accessToken'));
console.log('Refresh Token:', getCookie('refreshToken'));
```

## If Cookies Are Not Being Set

The issue might be that the response format from your backend doesn't match. 

### Check Backend Response Format

Your backend should return EXACTLY:
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "refreshToken": "eyJhbGc...",
  "tokenType": "Bearer"
}
```

### Check if field names match

In your Postman screenshot, I see:
- `accessToken` ✅
- `refreshToken` ✅  
- `userId` (extra field - okay)
- `role` (extra field - okay)
- `tokenType` (extra field - okay)

This should work fine.

## Most Likely Issue

Based on the console, I suspect the error is happening in the `.toPromise()` conversion. 

**Try this now:**

1. **Clear browser cookies completely**
   - Press F12
   - Go to Application tab
   - Click "Clear site data" button
   - Refresh page

2. **Try login again**

3. **Watch console carefully** - look for which line shows the error

## If Still Failing

Take a screenshot of:
1. The expanded console error (click the triangle next to the error objects)
2. The Network tab showing the signin request and response
3. The Application tab showing Cookies

This will help me see exactly what's going wrong!
